h1.jquery.elastic.extended

jquery.elastic is an excellent jquery plugin made by Jan jarfalk, which provides the elastic functionality to a textarea.

When I use it in my project, I need to toggle a textarea between elastic and unelastic according to user's behavior, but 
the plugin doesn't provide a `unelastic` method, so I extended the original plugin a little bit, to provide a `unelastic`
method to clear things up.
